If crooked Hillary wins than she will sell out our country for personal favors. Politicians only care about themselves they will never put us first. Donald is the first candidate in the history of our country to donate tens of millions of dollars to his own campaign. The more that people learn about Donald the more they will like him. Trump's poll numbers are continuing to rise! Lets ride this momentum all the way to The White House! I have been saying it since the beginning Trump Will Win! Lets make it happen.\n",
